        // Explore advanced features and suggest their implementation

        // 1. Advanced Animations:
        //    - Use more sophisticated animation techniques (e.g., spring animations, physics-based animations) to enhance the user experience. Consider using libraries like `react-spring` (if applicable to your project).
        //    - Implement custom transitions between views for a more polished look and feel.

        // 2. Offline Capabilities:
        //    - Allow users to continue using some features (e.g., transcription, text editing) even without an internet connection. This requires local data storage and potentially a local AI model.

        // 3. Dynamic Type Support:
        //    - Ensure your app fully supports dynamic type, allowing users to adjust the text size to their preference.

        // 4. Accessibility Enhancements:
        //    - Implement VoiceOver support for all UI elements.
        //    - Add support for switch control and other accessibility features.

        // 5. Advanced Haptics:
        //    - Use Core Haptics to provide more nuanced and informative haptic feedback. This can enhance the user experience and provide feedback beyond simple vibrations.

        // 6. Dark Mode Support:
        //    - Ensure your app looks great in both light and dark mode.

        // 7. Widget Support:
        //    - Create widgets for quick access to key features (e.g., quick translation, recent transcriptions).

        // 8. WatchOS Integration:
        //    - Extend the app to Apple Watch for quick access to translation and transcription.

        // 9. SwiftUI Enhancements:
        //    - Use SwiftUI's declarative approach to create a more maintainable and efficient UI. Consider using advanced SwiftUI features like `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, and `Environment`.

        // 10. Machine Learning Integration:
        //     - Explore using Core ML or other machine learning models to improve the accuracy of transcription and translation. This could involve training custom models for specific languages or dialects.
    }

    func suggestImprovements() {
        // Suggest improvements to the user experience

        // 1. User Feedback Mechanism:
        //    - Add a mechanism for users to provide feedback (e.g., in-app feedback form, email).

        // 2. Improved Error Handling:
        //    - Provide more user-friendly error messages and handle errors gracefully.

        // 3. Onboarding Experience:
        //    - Create a more engaging and informative onboarding experience to guide new users.

        // 4. UI/UX Refinements:
        //    - Review the UI/UX design for areas of improvement. Consider user testing to identify pain points.

        // 5. Performance Optimization:
        //    - Profile the app to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.

        // 6. Internationalization:
        //    - Ensure the app is fully localized for multiple languages.

        // 7. Personalized Settings:
        //    - Allow users to customize various settings (e.g., voice selection, theme).

        // 8. Data Privacy:
        //    - Clearly explain how user data is collected and used. Ensure compliance with privacy regulations.

        // 9. Security:
        //    - Implement robust security measures to protect user data.

        // 10. Testing:
        //     - Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix bugs before release.
